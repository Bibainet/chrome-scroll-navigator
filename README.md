Scroll navigator browser extension
==================================

#### Just move a mouse cursor to the screen left edge on any page and click.

* Left click on the left edge of any page — scroll to the top.
* Right click — scroll to the bottom.
* Click again — return to the previous position and continue reading.
* Click on the toolbar icon — scroll to the top/bottom.
* Drag the left edge — scroll to the specified position.

This extension does not affect the appearance of web pages, it does not create "_scroll to the top_" buttons.

So, you don't need to aim any buttons, just move a mouse cursor to the screen left edge, **fast and easy**!

This extension may not work properly on some websites with nonstandard layout implementation.
