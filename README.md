Scroll navigator browser extension
==================================

**Just move a mouse pointer to the screen left edge on any page and click.**

* Left click on the left edge of any page — scroll to the top.
* Right click — scroll to the bottom.
* Click again — return to the previous position and continue reading.
* Click on the toolbar icon — scroll to the top/bottom.
* Drag the left edge — scroll to the specified position.

This extension does not affect the appearance of web pages, it does not create "scroll to the top" buttons.
So, you don't need to aim any buttons, just move a mouse pointer to the screen left edge, **fast and easy**!

To use this extension, the browser window should be maximized, side bar should be hidden.

This extension may not work properly on some websites with nonstandard layout implementation.
